Project idea - 
Wiki for race tracks in the United States 
I want the CLI to be able to display a list of all of a specific type of track.   Then the user can enter a number to find out additional information about that specific racetrack. 

CLI should also be able to provide info about the oldest track, the newest track, shortest and longest.
